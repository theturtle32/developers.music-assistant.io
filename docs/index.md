Developer docs
==================================

## 📝 Prerequisites

- ffmpeg (minimum version 6.1, version 7 recommended), must be available in the path so install at OS level
- Python 3.12 is minimal required, 3.12 recommended (or check the pyproject for current required version)
- [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

We recommend developing on a (recent) macOS or Linux machine.
It is recommended to use Visual Studio Code as your IDE, since launch files to start Music Assistant are provided as part of the repository. Furthermore, the current code base is not verified to work on a native Windows machine. If you would like to develop on a Windows machine, install [WSL2](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/09/03/wsl2) to increase your swag-level 🤘.

## 🏛 Architecture

The [Architecture](architecture/index.md) section explains how the server fits together, with a
page per subsystem and reading paths for the common starting points. It hands off to the
[package docs](packages/index.md), which are the `README.md` files living beside the code. Both are
pulled from the [server repository](https://github.com/music-assistant/server) when this site is
built, so they stay in step with the code they describe.

## 🚀 Setting up your development environment

### Python venv (recommended)
With this repository cloned locally, execute the following commands in a terminal from the root of your repository:

- Run our development setup script to setup the development environment:
- `scripts/setup.sh` (creates a new separate virtual environment to nicely separate the project dependencies)
- The setup script will create a separate virtual environment (if needed), install all the project/test dependencies and configure pre-commit for linting and testing.
- Make sure, that the python interpreter in VS Code is set to the newly generated venv.
- Debug: Hit (Fn +) F5 to start Music Assistant locally
- The pre-compiled UI of Music Assistant will be available at `localhost:8095` 🎉

NOTE: Always re-run the setup script after you fetch the latest code because requirements could have changed.

### Using Devcontainer/Codespace
We removed support for devcontainers because we do not have anyone willing to maintain it.
It also is not very convenient due to all the port requirements, binaries etc.
If somebody is willing to create and maintain a devcontainer with host networking and based on our base alpine image, we will add the support back. Until then: Develop with Python venv on a Linux or macOS machine (see above).

### Developing on the Music Assistant Server Models

If you're working on core Music Assistant features, you may need to modify the shared data models. The **Python models which are shared between client and server** are located in the [`music-assistant/models`](https://github.com/music-assistant/models) repository, while the corresponding **client-side TypeScript interfaces** are in [`interfaces.ts`](https://github.com/music-assistant/frontend/blob/main/src/plugins/api/interfaces.ts) in the [Frontend repository](https://github.com/music-assistant/frontend).

In most cases, you won't need to modify the models. However, if you do need to make changes, here's how to set up your development environment to use a local models repository instead of the one installed via pip:

  - First, clone the [`models` repository](https://github.com/music-assistant/models) to your local machine.

  - Then, install your local `models` clone in "**editable**" mode. This allows your changes to be reflected immediately without a reinstall. Run the following command from the server repository's root:

    ```bash
    uv pip install -e /path/to/your/cloned/models/repo --config-settings editable_mode=strict
    ```

!!! note
    You must rerun this command whenever you add or remove files from the `models` repository to ensure the changes are picked up.

## Note on async Python

The Music Assistant server is fully built in Python. The Python language has no real supported for multi-threading. This is why Music Assistant heavily relies on asyncio to handle blocking IO. It is important to get a good understanding of asynchronous programming before building your first provider. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-UcUs7IMIM) video is an excellent first step in the world of asyncio.

## Building a new Music Provider

A Music Provider is the provider type that adds support for a 'source of music' to Music Assistant. Spotify and Youtube Music are examples of a Music Provider, but also Filesystem and SMB can be put in the Music Provider category. All Providers (of all types) can be found in the `music_assistant/providers` folder.

TIP: We have created a template/stub ["Demo Music Provider"](https://github.com/music-assistant/server/tree/dev/music_assistant/providers/_demo_music_provider) implementation in `music_assistant/providers/_demo_music_provider` to help you get started faster with building your new Music Provider for Music Assistant server!

**Adding the necessary files for a new Music Provider**

Add a new folder to the `providers` folder with the name of provider. Add two files inside:

1. `__init__.py`. This file contains the Python code of your provider.
2. `manifest.json`. This file contains metadata and configuration for your provider.

**Configuring the manifest.json file**

The easiest way to get start is to copy the contents of the manifest of an existing Music Provider, e.g. Spotify or Youtube Music. See [the manifest section](#manifest-file) for all available properties.

**Creating the provider**

Create a file called `__init__.py` inside the folder of your provider. This file will contain the logic for the provider. All Music Providers must inherit from the [`MusicProvider`](https://github.com/music-assistant/server/blob/dev/music_assistant/models/music_provider.py) base class and override the necessary functions where applicable. A few things to note:

- The `setup()` function is called by Music Assistant upon initialization of the provider. It gives you the opportunity the prepare the provider for usage.
- Anything interactive (credentials, OAuth logins, pairing) belongs in a [setup flow](setup-flows.md); runtime options are declared by overriding `get_config_entries()` on the provider.
- A provider should let Music Assistant know which [`ProviderFeature`](https://github.com/music-assistant/models/blob/main/music_assistant_models/enums.py) it supports by implementing the property `supported_features`, which returns a list of `ProviderFeature`.
- The actual playback of audio in Music Assistant happens in two phases:
    1. `get_stream_details()` is called to obtain information about the audio, like the quality, format, # of channels etc.
    2. `get_audio_stream()` is called to stream raw bytes of audio to the player. There are a few [helpers](https://github.com/music-assistant/server/blob/dev/music_assistant/helpers/audio.py) to help you with this. Note that this function is not applicable to direct url streams.
- Examples:
    1. Streaming raw bytes using an external executable (librespot) to get audio, see the [Spotify](https://github.com/music-assistant/server/blob/dev/music_assistant/providers/spotify/__init__.py) provider as an example
    2. Streaming a direct URL, see the [Youtube Music](https://github.com/music-assistant/server/blob/dev/music_assistant/providers/ytmusic/__init__.py) provider as an example
    3. Streaming an https stream that uses an expiring URL, see the [Qobuz](https://github.com/music-assistant/server/blob/dev/music_assistant/providers/qobuz/__init__.py) provider as an example


## ▶️ Building your own Player Provider

A Player Provider is the provider type that adds support for a 'target of playback' to Music Assistant. Sonos, Chromecast and AirPlay are examples of a Player Provider.
All Providers (of all types) can be found in the `music_assistant/providers` folder.

TIP: We have created a template/stub ["Demo Player Provider"](https://github.com/music-assistant/server/tree/dev/music_assistant/providers/_demo_player_provider) implementation" in `music_assistant/providers/_template_player_provider` to help get you started faster with building your own Player Provider for Music Assistant server!

## 💽 Building your own Metadata Provider

A Metadata Provider is the provider type that provides additional metadata which is missing from the preliminary items obtained from the music provider sources. They supplement metadata in the Music Assistant server database by importing information or album artwork from other online sources that are then added to the library. For example, the metadata providers for MusicBrainz, fanart.tv, and Cover Art Archive. Note that metadata providers do NOT change anything (e.g. ID3 tags) obtained from the original item.

More information and template/stub demo metadata provider to follow.

## 🔌 Building your own Plugin Provider

A Plugin Provider is the provider type that provides additional functionality to Music Assistant and most often it will interact with the existing core controllers and event logic. For example a music scrobbling plugin such as the [LastFM Scrobbler Plugin](https://www.music-assistant.io/plugins/lastfm_scrobble/) (that lets you [scrobble](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/scrobble) songs and albums you listen to LastFM and LibreFM), or the [AirPlay Receiver Plugin](https://www.music-assistant.io/plugins/airplay-receiver/) (that enable you to add AirPlay Receiver audio support to any MA player), or the [Home Assistant Plugin Provider](https://www.music-assistant.io/ha-plugin/) (that provides a connection from the Music Assistant integration running in Home Assistant to Music Assistant server that allow exposing HA players so that they become visible in MA).

More information and template/stub demo plugin provider to follow.

## ⚙️ Manifest file

The manifest file contains metadata and configuration about a provider. The supported properties are:

| Name  | Description  | Type  |
|---|---|---|
| type  | `music`, `player`, `metadata` or `plugin`  | string  |
| domain  | The internal unique id of the provider, e.g. `spotify` or `ytmusic`  | string  |
| name  | The full name of the provider, e.g. `Spotify` or `Youtube Music`  | string  |
| description  | The full description of the provider  | string  |
| codeowners  | List of Github names of the codeowners of the provider  | array[string]  |
| requirements | List of requirements for the provider in pip string format. Supported values are `package==version` and `git+https://gitrepoforpackage` | array[string]
| documentation | URL to the Github discussion containing the documentation for the provider. | string |
| multi_instances | Whether multiple instances of the configuration are supported, e.g. multiple user accounts for Spotify | boolean |

Provider configuration is not declared in the manifest: interactive setup (credentials, OAuth, pairing) is authored as a [setup flow](setup-flows.md), and runtime options are declared in code by overriding `get_config_entries()` — see [Provider setup flows](setup-flows.md).
